      See #codeathome announcements for the link to our learning platform edyoucated.
  - title: Am I supposed to receive a personalized track? Why is there a survey?
    content: |
      For the #codeathome Bootcamp, we don't offer any tailored tracks due to the intense and relatively short learning phase. You can select between the four different tracks (Web Development, UX/UI, Data Science, and AI). We only offer personalized tracks for the local programs, to fill out the survey is only needed there.
  - title: When should I start working on the online courses? Are there any fix lessons? 
    content: |
      We recommend to start as early as possible to be able to finish your track in **approximately 6 weeks, in order to have enough time to work on your project.** There aren't any regular lessons, you have full flexibility and control over your learning time and can decide when you want to work on your learning track(s). However, we have set learning milestones, which you can use to orientate yourself.
  - title: Is there a Deadline to complete the tracks? 
    content: |
      You have to complete your track(s) by the **31st of October** to get a certificate.
  - title: How much time do I have to study?
    content: |
      We recommend to study 6-10 hours per week on your track.
  - title: Is it possible to do more than one track within the nine weeks ? 
    content: |
      Yes it is. Theoretically you can do all four tracks if you have enough time. However, we recommend focusing on one track at a time in order to deepen your knowledge and understanding of the topic. Join us again in the next #codeathome Bootcamp batch to develop your digital skills in a different field! **Sign up for the newsletter and stay informed.**
  - title: How will I get to know the other participants? 
    content: |
      We have a vibrant slack community in which you will be invited. Furthermore, you will be grouped with 3-5 other Techies from your track. Together with your TrackStudy-Buddies, you can study, have remote coffees, and apply for the project phase.

      *(See also Project Phase: During the project phase, you will work in a diverse team and solve a societal challenge with your newly developed tech skills. This is where you will definitely get in touch with your fellow learners, learn from each other, and build a great product!)*
  - title: Who are my TrackStudy-Buddies and when will I meet them?
    content: |
      We will pair you with 3-5 other Techies studying the same main track during the first week. Together with your TrackStudy-Buddies, you can study, have remote coffees, and work together during the project phase. We will create a private Slack channel for you and your TrackStudy-Buddies, where you can meet remotely.
  - title: Are the Tracks still accessible after the nine weeks?

      Yes, you will have access to edyoucated after the #codeathome Bootcamp. But have in mind that you need to finish your track(s) to get the certificate by 31st October. 
  - title: Will I get a certificate for each track?
    content: |
      You will get a certificate for each completed track. Also you have to hand in one solution with your project team - not one for each track, just one for all!

      You will be grouped with 3-5 other Techies from your main track at the end of the first week of the #codeathome Bootcamp. You and your TrackStudy-Buddies can register for the Project Phase (at least 3 people).

      If you lose your TrackStudy-Buddies, or you want to work with other Techies, **you can also apply as an individual** (We will make an announcement in Slack!). Those who sign up as individuals will be formed into teams by us to ensure diverse backgrounds and a good mixture of advanced techies and beginners

    content: |
      Yes, of course! We encourage you to have at least 60% of your online-learning done when the Project Phase starts. You can continue learning while working with your project team. We recommend to finish online-learning as early as possible, so you can fully concentrate on your project work and the submission in the last weeks
  - title: Why does the Project Phase start next to the online-learning?
    content: |
      We want to give you and your team enough time for working on your project, get to know each other, and set up a remote project working environment. We recommend finishing the online-learning until week 6 so that you can focus on the project work henceforth.
  - title: How should we start and find a project idea?
    content: |
      We will give you an overall topic for the Project Phase, as a frame. Together with your team, you will come up with an idea: Conduct a Design Thinking workshop, brainstorm or create a mind map together in order to elaborate ideas. With your project idea, you and your team mates can register for the Project Phase in week 5. We will keep you informed about the timing and deadlines in our Slack announcements channel.
